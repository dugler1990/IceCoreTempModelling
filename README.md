# Temperature Modelling Using Icecore Data

## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit application developed for modeling temperature using ice core data, with the capability to handle other tabular datasets as well. The application is designed to test various models and analyze their performance in relation to historical temperature data.

### Streamlit App

You can access the application here: [Icecore Temperature Modelling App](https://icecoretempmodelling-su4mds3nvzenpfcbycjzjw.streamlit.app)

## Background

The application utilizes data related to Milankovitch cycles, which are believed to be significant drivers of temperature and CO2 variations during glacial and interglacial periods. The analysis focuses on data from the Antarctic region, incorporating large volcanic activity datasets as well.

### Data Preparation

For details on data preparation and processing, please refer to the `data_prep` directory.
